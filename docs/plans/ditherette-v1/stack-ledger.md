## S01 inherited port anchor

- Issue: [#42](https://github.com/mia-cx/ditherette/issues/42), parent PRD [#41](https://github.com/mia-cx/ditherette/issues/41).
- Owner: S01 anchor agent. Worktree: `.worktrees/v1-s01-anchor`.
- Branch: `impl/v1-s01-anchor`. PR base: `main`. PR: [#75](https://github.com/mia-cx/ditherette/pull/75), open and non-draft.
- Main: `edc87f5da2b6958f7d9c892483e08af8149482b4`.
- Inherited port: `5a5872badbba796f4effe92aba8051b43e30233e` (`origin/feat/rust-wasm-port`).
- Rebased code checkpoint: `a9928ebe55a2571b4e6bb35fedea80aff5474302`. Dependencies: none.
- Validated code and plan head: `0f33dbdf123cf367362a8473c2e95bf1223a2c3c`. Later S01 commits record evidence only; the PR records the delivered head.

All 448 inherited commits were replayed onto main. Two `.gitignore` conflicts preserved the port's fixture changes and main's `.ant-colony/` exclusion. The rebased tree differs from the inherited port only by that exclusion. Original port history remains on its existing branch. Root worktree edits remain untouched.

### Baseline evidence

Checks run in the isolated worktree at the rebased code checkpoint:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test --manifest-path crates/ditherette-wasm/Cargo.toml --locked` | Passed, 110 native tests; no doctests. |
| `cargo check --manifest-path crates/ditherette-wasm/Cargo.toml --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` | Passed. |
| `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/ditherette-wasm/Cargo.toml --check` | Passed. |
| `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` | Passed. |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | Existing setup failure under pnpm 11.13.0: `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. The inherited `onlyBuiltDependencies` configuration does not satisfy pnpm 11's `allowBuilds` policy. Dependencies were installed; generated manifest placeholders were removed. |
| `pnpm exec vitest run --project server src/lib/processing src/lib/wasm/ditherette-wasm.spec.ts` | Blocked by pnpm's automatic reinstall and the same build-policy failure. |
| `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run --project server src/lib/processing src/lib/wasm/ditherette-wasm.spec.ts` | Passed, 16 files and 120 tests. |

Tool versions: Rust/Cargo 1.97.0, Node 24.19.0, pnpm 11.13.0.

No new baseline failures were found. S02 owns the inherited package/build policy issue. Direct Vitest invocation validates processing and wrapper tests without changing that policy.

No benchmark process ran. Native export tests include their existing benchmark-wrapper smoke assertions; these do not establish performance evidence. Browser, threaded-runtime, full website-build, and release conformance checks remain later slice obligations.

### Next dependencies

S01 implementation is available at validated code/plan head `0f33dbdf123cf367362a8473c2e95bf1223a2c3c`, with evidence at `60bfa968e9541f14e2e1490a7829f91dda490d89`. This subsequent entry only records the PR URL. S02, S03, and S04 can use the delivered PR head, which contains both checkpoints. Child PRs target `impl/v1-s01-anchor` and record its exact SHA. All PRs remain unmerged.
